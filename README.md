## :man_scientist: about me

Hello! My name is **Ircham Ali**, and I reside in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, surrounded by diverse individuals. I have had a passion for programming and design since 2012, sparked by witnessing my lecturer perform some "magic" with their computer. Since 2021, I have been an informatics lecturer at [UNUSIA](https://unusia.ac.id), and to this day, I continue to coding as my hobby.
